So far, you have
learned how to use SQL arithmetic operators to
perform basic functions. In this video, you'll take one step further
by learning how to use these arithmetic
operators in practice when working
with a database. Let's explore the use
of arithmetic operators using the example of a corporate
table of employee data. It's populated with the
following information about each employee: ID,
name, and salary. I'm going to demonstrate
how to use each of the arithmetic
operators in SQL to perform various functions with this practical data and
retrieve the desired results. In this first example, let's say that an
employer wants to give each employee on their
team a $500 bonus. But first, they'd
like to see what each employee's salary looks
like after adding the $500. I can type SELECT salary plus 500 FROM employee to add the $500 bonus to
each employee's salary. The SELECT command works by retrieving the salary
of each employee from the employee table and then
adding $500 to each value. Let's execute the query by
clicking the go button. The result is that
each employee's salary has increased by 500. You can create other statements that use the SELECT
command in a similar way. For example, let's say
the employer wants to deduct $500 from the
salary of each employee. To do this, I typed the
SQL query statement. SELECT salary minus
500 from employee. Again, I'm using the
select command to retrieve the salary value of
each employee record stored in the employee table. This time, I used
a subtraction sign minus subtract $500 from the
salary of each employee. Now I click the Go button and the database returns
a table that shows the output result of salaries
after the deductions. In the next example, let's imagine a scenario where the employer would
like to increase the employee's salaries by doubling their current
annual salary. To do this, I use the
SELECT command to perform the same function
as discussed previously. I then use the
multiplication sign, an asterisk symbol to multiply the salary value
of each employee by two. The SQL statement now reads SELECT salary asterisks
two from employee. I can now click the Go button
to generate an output of the results of salaries from multiplying the values by two. Now let's suppose the
employer needs to determine the monthly
salary of each employee. I can perform this task using an SQL query statement as I have done in the
previous scenarios. However, this time I'll divide the annual
salary by 12 months. To determine the monthly salary. My statement reads as follows. SELECT salary forward
slash 12 FROM employee. The select command retrieves the salary value
for each employee stored in the employee table. Then division sign or the forward slash divides the
annual salary value by 12. I click the Go button to
generate the output results. The employer can now
use this output result to determine what each
employee's monthly salary is. In our final example, the employer would like
to know if the ID of each employee is an
even or odd number. I can use the modulus operator
to complete this task. I just need to type the
following statement. SELECT ID modulus two from employee. I then click Go to
execute the statement. This divides each employee ID by two and returns the remainder
of the division operation. In this case, a remainder
of 0 denotes an even id as all even numbers
are divisible by two, meaning there will
be no remainder. The result shows that there are three odd IDs and to even IDs. You should now know
how to make use of the SQL arithmetic
operators in a database. You're making great
progress. Keep it up.
