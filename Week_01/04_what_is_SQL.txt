At this stage in the course, you're probably familiar
with the basics of databases and how they
store and manage data. But it's also important
that you know how to interact with databases in
order to work with data. As a data engineer, you can interact
with databases using Structured Query Language or
as it's more commonly known, SQL, also pronounced as sequel. Over the next few
minutes you'll learn how to explain what SQL is and outline the
role of SQL in databases. What sort of interactions do database engineers need to
establish with databases? Some of the operations
you could carry it in the data might require
you to create, read, update, and delete data. These operations are also
known as CRUD operations. You might already be familiar with some of these operations. If not, don't worry, they'll be covered in depth at later stages in this course. Let's find out more about SQL. SQL is the standard
language that can be used with all databases. It's particularly useful when working with
relational databases, which require a
language that can interact with structured data. Some examples of
relational databases that SQL can interact
with include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and
Microsoft SQL Server. The next question this raises, is how does a
database interpret or read and execute instructions
given using SQL. A database interprets and make
sense of SQL instructions with the use of a Database
Management System or DBMS. As a web developer,
you'll execute all SQL instructions on
a database using a DBMS. The DBMS takes responsibility
for transforming SQL instructions into a form that's understood by the
underlying database. This was just a very quick
introduction to SQL. At this early stage, you should be able
to explain what SQL is and explain the role
of SQL in databases. In the upcoming videos, you'll learn more about SQL and develop a deeper understanding
of the language.
